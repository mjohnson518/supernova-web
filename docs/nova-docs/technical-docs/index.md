## Technical Overview

Supernova is built with a focus on quantum resistance, security, and environmental sustainability. Our technical architecture implements post-quantum cryptographic primitives while maintaining the proven security model of proof-of-work.

### Key Technical Features

- **Post-quantum cryptography**: Implementation of lattice-based cryptography (Dilithium) for signatures
- **Advanced consensus mechanism**: Modified proof-of-work with environmental optimizations
- **Security by design**: Multiple layers of protection against common attack vectors
- **Rust-based implementation**: Memory safety and performance benefits
- **Scalable architecture**: Designed for enterprise-grade throughput and reliability
