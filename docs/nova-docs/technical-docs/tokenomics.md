# SuperNova Tokenomics

This document provides detailed information about SuperNova's token economics, including the foundation's role, token allocation, vesting schedules, operational expenses, and environmental treasury management.

## 1. NOVA Token Overview

### 1.1 Token Basics

- **Name**: SuperNova Token
- **Symbol**: NOVA
- **Total Supply**: 42,000,000 NOVA
- **Type**: Native blockchain token
- **Smallest Unit**: 1 attonova (0.000000000000000001 NOVA)
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Environmentally-aware Proof of Work
- **Environmental Feature**: Carbon-negative by design
- **Launch Date**: Q3 2025

### 1.2 Token Utility

The NOVA token serves multiple functions within the SuperNova ecosystem:

1. **Transaction Fees**: NOVA is used to pay for transaction fees on the network
2. **Mining Rewards**: Miners receive NOVA as rewards for securing the network
3. **Environmental Treasury**: A portion of tokens is allocated to ensuring carbon negativity
4. **Governance**: NOVA holders can participate in governance decisions
5. **Smart Contract Platform**: NOVA can be used within the ecosystem's smart contract applications
6. **Lightning Network Operations**: Required for opening payment channels and routing

## 2. Token Allocation

### 2.1 Initial Distribution

The total supply of 42,000,000 NOVA tokens is allocated as follows:

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Amount (NOVA) | Purpose |
|---------------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Mining Rewards | 40% | 16,800,000 | Network security incentives |
| Foundation Reserve | 13.5% | 5,670,000 | Long-term ecosystem development |
| Ecosystem Development | 15% | 6,300,000 | Grants, partnerships, and marketing |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 6,300,000 | Team compensation and advisory services |
| Environmental Treasury | 10% | 4,200,000 | Ensuring carbon negativity |
| Community & Airdrops | 4.5% | 1,890,000 | Community building and adoption |
| Liquidity Reserve | 2% | 840,000 | Market making and liquidity provision |

The Liquidity Reserve is a dedicated allocation managed by the Treasury Committee to ensure stable, deep markets for NOVA tokens. This allocation reduces selling pressure on the Foundation Reserve while providing professional market making services.

```

## 3. Mining Rewards & Emissions Schedule

### 3.1 Block Rewards

Mining rewards follow a halving schedule similar to Bitcoin, but with environmental adjustments:

- **Initial Block Reward**: 50 NOVA
- **Block Time**: 2.5 minutes (average)
- **Blocks Per Day**: ~576
- **Initial Daily Emission**: ~28,800 NOVA
- **Halving Schedule**: Every 840,000 blocks (approximately 4 years)

### 3.2 Reward Schedule

| Period | Blocks | Block Reward | Daily Issuance | Period Supply | % of Total |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Year 1-4 | 0-840,000 | 50 NOVA | 28,800 NOVA | 8,400,000 NOVA | 20.00% |
| Year 5-8 | 840,001-1,680,000 | 25 NOVA | 14,400 NOVA | 4,200,000 NOVA | 10.00% |
| Year 9-12 | 1,680,001-2,520,000 | 12.5 NOVA | 7,200 NOVA | 2,100,000 NOVA | 5.00% |
| Year 13-16 | 2,520,001-3,360,000 | 6.25 NOVA | 3,600 NOVA | 1,050,000 NOVA | 2.50% |
| Year 17-20 | 3,360,001-4,200,000 | 3.125 NOVA | 1,800 NOVA | 525,000 NOVA | 1.25% |

The emission continues with halvings every 840,000 blocks until all 16,800,000 mining reward tokens are distributed (approximately 20-24 years).

### 3.3 Environmental Mining Adjustments

SuperNova implements a unique environmental reward system:

- **Green Mining Bonus**: Miners using verified renewable energy receive up to 20% additional rewards
- **Verification**: Renewable energy use must be verified through the SuperNova certification system
- **Energy Efficiency Bonus**: Miners demonstrating exceptional energy efficiency can receive up to 10% additional rewards

### 5.5 Token Launch Mechanism

Supernova will implement a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) for fair and efficient price discovery:

- **Launch Format**: 7-day Balancer LBP with dynamic weighting
- **Initial Pool Structure**: 
  - Starting weight: 90% NOVA / 10% USDC
  - Ending weight: 50% NOVA / 50% USDC
  - Initial NOVA allocation: 1,050,000 tokens (1/2 of initial Community & Airdrop allocation)
  
- **Price Parameters**:
  - Starting price ceiling: $6.30 USDC
  - No price floor (true price discovery)
  - Target equilibrium: ~$4.20 USDC
  
- **Participation**: Open to public, KYC required for purchases over $10,000 USD
- **Anti-whale Measures**: Maximum individual contribution of $50,000 in first 24 hours
- **Post-LBP**: Unsold tokens return to Community allocation, sold tokens create initial DEX liquidity

This mechanism ensures:
1. Fair market-determined price discovery
2. Protection against front-running and whale manipulation
3. Efficient capital deployment with minimal initial volatility
4. Broader initial token distribution

### 5.6 Strategic Investment Framework

Prior to public launch, the Foundation will secure strategic investors through a structured approach:

  - Demonstrated alignment with SuperNova's environmental mission
  - Technical expertise in blockchain infrastructure or quantum computing
  - Long-term investment horizon (minimum 2-year lockup with linear vesting)
  - Ability to provide technical, operational, or market-making support
  - Geographic diversity across key markets

- **Investment Structure**:
  - Price: 20% discount to expected LBP target price
  - Lockup: 6-month cliff, 24-month linear vesting thereafter
  - Participation rights in future governance decisions
  - Maximum allocation per investor: 105,000 NOVA (0.25% of total supply)

- **Strategic Partner Categories**:

| Category | Allocation | Example Partners |

| Technical | 30% | Post-quantum security, mining innovation |
| Financial | 20% | Market makers, crypto-native funds |
| Ecosystem | 20% | DeFi protocols, infrastructure projects |

The strategic investment round will close at least 30 days before the public LBP launch.

### 5.7 Market Liquidity Strategy

## 6. Environmental Treasury Management

### 6.1 Carbon Negativity Mechanism

The Environmental Treasury supports SuperNova's carbon negative commitment through:

1. **Fee Allocation**: A percentage of transaction fees automatically allocated to environmental initiatives
2. **Token Reserve**: 10% of total supply (4,200,000 NOVA) reserved for environmental purposes
3. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Fee allocation percentage adjusts based on carbon negativity metrics
4. **Verification**: Third-party verification of carbon offset purchases and renewable certificates
5. **Transparency**: Public dashboard showing real-time emissions and offsets

### 6.2 Fee Allocation Structure

Transaction fees are partially allocated to environmental initiatives:

- **Base Allocation**: 2% of transaction fees
- **Dynamic Range**: 1-5% based on carbon negativity metrics
- **Adjustment Mechanism**: If carbon negativity ratio falls below target, allocation increases
- **Maximum Impact**: Designed to have minimal impact on transaction costs

### 6.3 Environmental Fund Allocation

The environmental treasury funds are allocated as follows:

| Category | Base Allocation | Description |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Renewable Energy Certificates | 50% | Direct support for renewable energy generation |
