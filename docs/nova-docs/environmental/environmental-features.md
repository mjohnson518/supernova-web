## Overview

Supernova's environmental features are designed to address the carbon footprint of blockchain operations by:

1. **Measuring Impact**: Tracking energy consumption and carbon emissions at the network, block, and transaction level.
2. **Providing Incentives**: Encouraging miners to use renewable energy through fee discounts and prioritization.
3. **Offsetting Emissions**: Allocating a portion of transaction fees to purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets.
4. **Ensuring Transparency**: Providing comprehensive reporting on environmental metrics and mitigation efforts.
5. **Supporting Governance**: Allowing community input on environmental treasury allocation.

These features aim to make Supernova carbon-negative by design, prioritizing renewable energy generation over carbon offsets while maintaining full transparency.

## Emissions Tracking

### Methodology

Supernova's emissions tracking system uses the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) methodology to estimate energy consumption, combined with region-specific emissions factors to calculate carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions.

The system accounts for:

- **Geographic Distribution**: Mining operations in different regions have different carbon intensities based on local electricity grid compositions.
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Different mining hardware has varying energy efficiency (Joules per Terahash).
- **Renewable Energy**: Self-reported and verified renewable energy usage by miners.
- **RECs and Offsets**: Accounting for purchased renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets.

### Tracking Components

1. **Regional Emissions Factors Database**
   - Contains emissions factors (gCO₂e/kWh) for different regions
   - Updated regularly from authoritative sources
   - Prioritizes marginal emissions data where available
   - Fallback to grid average emissions when necessary

2. **Mining Hardware Database**
   - Energy efficiency data for various ASIC models
   - Updated with new hardware specifications
   - Age-based derating for older equipment

3. **Transaction-level Attribution**
   - Assigns proportional emissions to transactions based on:
     - Transaction size (bytes)
     - Transaction complexity (computational cost)
     - Block space consumed
   - Calculated in real-time for all transactions

4. **Network-level Metrics**
   - Total energy consumption (kWh)
   - Total carbon emissions (tonnes CO₂e)
   - Renewable energy percentage
   - Net carbon impact after mitigation
   - Carbon intensity per transaction

### Verification System

The emissions tracking system includes verification mechanisms for:

- **Miner Location**: GPS coordinates, IP geolocation, third-party audits
- **Renewable Energy Claims**: Energy attribute certificates, bilateral contracts, direct ownership
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Performance benchmarks, power consumption tests
- **Carbon Offsets**: Registry verification, additionality assessment, permanence evaluation

## Green Mining Incentives

### Overview

Supernova implements multiple incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy for mining:

1. **Fee Discounts**: Miners using verified renewable energy receive transaction fee discounts.
2. **Block Prioritization**: Transactions routed to green miners receive higher priority.
3. **REC Validation**: Miners can register renewable energy certificates for additional benefits.

### Fee Discount Structure

| Renewable Percentage | Verification Status | Fee Discount |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 95-100%              | Verified            | 10%          |
| 75-94%               | Verified            | 7%           |
| 50-74%               | Verified            | 5%           |
| 25-49%               | Verified            | 2%           |
| Any                  | Unverified          | 0%           |

Miners can increase their discounts by:
- Registering verifiable renewable energy certificates
- Providing third-party audits of energy sources
- Participating in carbon offset programs

### Verification Process

1. **Registration**: Miners register with the network, providing details about their energy sources.
2. **Documentation**: Miners submit evidence of renewable energy usage (utility bills, RECs, etc.).
3. **Verification**: Independent verifiers confirm the claims.
4. **Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring ensures continued compliance.
5. **Renewal**: Periodic re-verification to maintain status.

### Implementation Details

The incentive system is implemented through:

```rust
// Mining fee calculation with green incentives
pub fn calculate_mining_fee(&self, transaction_size: usize, miner_id: &str) -> u64 {
    let base_fee = self.calculate_base_fee(transaction_size);
    
    // Apply green miner discount if applicable
    if let Some(miner) = self.get_miner_info(miner_id) {
        if miner.verification_status == VerificationStatus::Verified {
            let discount_percentage = match miner.renewable_percentage {
                p if p >= 95.0 => 10.0,
                p if p >= 75.0 => 7.0,
                p if p >= 50.0 => 5.0,
                p if p >= 25.0 => 2.0,
                _ => 0.0,
            };
            
            let discount_multiplier = 1.0 - (discount_percentage / 100.0);
            return (base_fee as f64 * discount_multiplier) as u64;
        }
    }
    
    base_fee
}
```

## Environmental Treasury

### Overview

A portion of transaction fees is allocated to the Environmental Treasury, which funds:

1. **Renewable Energy Certificates**: Directly supporting new renewable energy projects
2. **Carbon Offset Projects**: Investing in verified carbon reduction/removal projects
3. **Environmental Grants**: Funding research and development of green mining technologies
