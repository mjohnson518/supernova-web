# Supernova Documentation

This directory contains the official documentation for the Supernova blockchain project. The documentation is organized into logical sections to provide a clear path for different user types.

## Current Version and Status

Supernova is currently at version **v1.0.0-BETA**. This production-grade beta represents a major milestone with all core functionality fully operational, comprehensive testing completed, and the network ready for testnet deployment. The codebase has undergone extensive optimization and security hardening.

### Key Implementation Milestones

- **Quantum Resistance**: Production-grade post-quantum cryptographic signatures using Falcon, Dilithium, and SPHINCS+ schemes, providing comprehensive protection against quantum computer attacks.
- **Environmental Tracking**: Complete real-time emissions monitoring with geographic attribution, automated green mining incentives, and fully operational environmental treasury for carbon offsets.
- **Advanced Security**: Battle-tested security manager implementing IP diversity, peer rotation, challenge-response systems, and behavioral scoring with proven resilience against various attack vectors.
- **Lightning Network**: Full production implementation of payment channels with HTLC support, complete channel lifecycle management, and comprehensive security measures.
- **Monitoring System**: Enterprise-grade blockchain metrics framework with real-time monitoring, alerting, and comprehensive dashboards for network health, environmental impact, performance, and security indicators.
- **Performance Optimization**: Extensive optimization work resulting in improved transaction throughput, reduced latency, and enhanced resource efficiency.

For a detailed breakdown of component implementation status, see the [Project Overview](overview/project-overview.md) page and the [Roadmap](overview/roadmap.md).
