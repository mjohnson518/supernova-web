## Governance Model

Supernova employs a hybrid governance model that combines:

1. **Foundation Oversight** - The Supernova Foundation provides strategic direction
2. **On-Chain Governance** - Token holders can vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations
3. **Technical Committee** - Expert panel that evaluates technical proposals
4. **Environmental Council** - Ensures adherence to environmental commitments

This model aims to balance decentralization with the need for expertise and strategic direction, particularly in maintaining the project's environmental commitments.

## Proposal Process

Community members can submit proposals through the following process:

1. **Pre-proposal Discussion** - Community forum debate
2. **Formal Submission** - Detailed proposal with specific implementation details
3. **Technical Review** - Assessment by the Technical Committee
4. **Community Vote** - On-chain voting by token holders
5. **Implementation** - Execution of approved proposals

The governance section provides more details about participation in this process.
