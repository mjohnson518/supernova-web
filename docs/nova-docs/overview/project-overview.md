# Supernova Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Supernova blockchain platform. This documentation provides detailed information about Supernova's technology, features, and how to interact with the network.

## Current Status

The project is currently at version 0.9.0-BETA. The architecture and core components have been designed and implemented, with all core functionality now operational. We've successfully resolved all compilation issues and the codebase builds successfully. The project features quantum-resistant cryptography, advanced security measures, comprehensive environmental impact tracking, and Lightning Network support.

Key highlights:

* **Compilation Success**: All compilation issues have been resolved and the codebase now builds successfully.
* **Quantum Resistance**: Post-quantum cryptographic signatures fully integrated using Falcon-based lattice cryptography, providing protection against quantum computer attacks.
* **Environmental Tracking**: Real-time emissions monitoring with geographical attribution, green mining incentives, and environmental treasury for carbon offsets.
* **Advanced Security**: Comprehensive security manager implementing IP diversity, peer rotation, challenge-response systems, and behavioral scoring to prevent various attack vectors.
* **Lightning Network**: Full implementation of payment channels with HTLC support, proper channel lifecycle management, and security measures.
* **Monitoring System**: Complete blockchain metrics framework tracking network health, environmental impact, performance, and security indicators.
* **Optimized Architecture**: Enhanced modular design with improved error handling, type-safe conversions, and proper async/await patterns throughout the codebase.
