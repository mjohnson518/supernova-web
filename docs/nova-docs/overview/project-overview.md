# Supernova Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Supernova blockchain platform. This documentation provides detailed information about Supernova's technology, features, and how to interact with the network.

## Current Status

The project is currently at version 0.7.5 in **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** state. While the architecture and core components have been designed, many features are still in development or have partial implementations. We've recently made significant progress in resolving compilation issues and improving code quality.

### Implementation Status

As of version 0.7.5, component implementation statuses are:

- **Core libraries (btclib)**: ~85% complete (key structures implemented, all major issues resolved)
- **Transaction Processing**: ~80% complete (validation framework fully implemented)
- **Mempool Management**: ~65% complete (basic structure with partial functionality)
- **Transaction Validation**: ~98% complete (comprehensive validation with quantum signature support)
- **Block Validation**: ~70% complete (basic validation with some advanced features missing)
- **Merkle Tree Implementation**: 100% complete
- **Network Layer**: ~45% complete (peer discovery and sync partially implemented)
- **Storage**: ~75% complete (disk storage for blocks and UTXO set mostly complete)
- **Consensus Engine**: ~65% complete (proof-of-work implementation with difficulty adjustment)
- **RPC API**: ~35% complete (basic node control and query endpoints)
- **Environmental Monitoring**: ~95% complete (tracking system for energy usage and carbon footprint)
- **Wallet**: ~30% complete (basic functionality only)
- **CLI**: ~40% complete
- **Testnet Tools**: ~90% complete (comprehensive simulation capabilities)

### Recent Progress

- **Compilation Progress**: All major compilation errors have been fixed! Recently resolved the NetworkSimulationConfig type conflicts in the testnet module, along with improving validation systems, cryptographic verification, and environmental tracking.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Post-quantum cryptographic signatures module is now fully integrated and compatible with the validation framework, supporting Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+ schemes.
- **Environmental Features**: Fixed compatibility issues in the environmental API and treasury system, enabling accurate tracking of energy usage and carbon offsets.
- **Transaction Validation**: Enhanced validation framework with comprehensive error handling, including support for both classical and post-quantum signature schemes.
- **Network Simulation**: Fixed type conflicts in the testnet network simulation infrastructure, allowing for comprehensive testing of network conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling throughout the codebase, particularly in the validation and cryptographic modules.

### Development Roadmap

1. **Current Phase (Finishing Q3 2023)**: Core system implementation with all compilation issues resolved
2. **Next Phase (Q4 2023)**: Testnet environment and improved testing infrastructure
3. **Near Future Phase (Q1 2024)**: Enhanced security, quantum resistance, and environmental features
