## Core Implementation Details

### Block Structure and Implementation

The core block structure is implemented with comprehensive validation and serialization mechanisms:

```rust
pub struct Block {
    header: BlockHeader,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
}

impl Block {
    pub fn new(
        version: u32,
        prev_block_hash: [u8; 32],
        transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
        target: u32,
    ) -> Self {
        let merkle_root = Self::calculate_merkle_root(&transactions);
        
        Self {
            header: BlockHeader::new(version, prev_block_hash, merkle_root, target),
            transactions,
        }
    }

    pub fn hash(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
        self.header.hash()
    }

    pub fn increment_nonce(&mut self) {
        self.header.increment_nonce();
    }

    fn calculate_merkle_root(transactions: &[Transaction]) -> [u8; 32] {
        let tx_bytes: Vec<Vec<u8>> = transactions
            .iter()
            .map(|tx| bincode::serialize(&tx).unwrap())
            .collect();

        let tree = MerkleTree::new(&tx_bytes);
        tree.root_hash().unwrap_or([0u8; 32])
    }

    pub fn validate(&self) -> bool {
        let hash = self.header.hash();
        let target = self.header.target;
        
        let hash_value = u32::from_be_bytes([hash[0], hash[1], hash[2], hash[3]]);
        
        if hash_value > target {
            return false;
        }

        let calculated_root = Self::calculate_merkle_root(&self.transactions);
        if calculated_root != self.header.merkle_root {
            return false;
        }

        true
    }
}
```

### Mining System

The mining system implements a multi-threaded approach to find valid blocks:

```rust
// Worker implementation for mining a block
pub struct MiningWorker {
    id: usize,
    template: Arc<BlockTemplate>,
    max_nonce: u32,
    metrics: Arc<MiningMetrics>,
}

impl MiningWorker {
    pub fn run(&mut self) -> Option<Block> {
        let mut block = self.template.create_block();
        let target_hash = block.target();
        let start_time = Instant::now();
        let mut hashes = 0;
        
        for nonce in 0..self.max_nonce {
            block.set_nonce(nonce);
            let hash = block.hash();
            hashes += 1;
            
            if hash_meets_target(&hash, target_hash) {
                self.metrics.report_block_found(self.id, nonce, start_time.elapsed());
                return Some(block);
            }
            
            // Update metrics periodically
            if hashes % 10000 == 0 {
                self.metrics.update_hash_rate(self.id, hashes, start_time.elapsed());
                hashes = 0;
            }
        }
        
        None
    }
}
```

### Transaction Processing System

The transaction system implements comprehensive UTXO management and validation:

```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    version: u32,
    inputs: Vec<TransactionInput>,
    outputs: Vec<TransactionOutput>,
    locktime: u32,
}

impl Transaction {
    pub fn new(
        version: u32,
        inputs: Vec<TransactionInput>,
        outputs: Vec<TransactionOutput>,
        locktime: u32,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            version,
            inputs,
            outputs,
            locktime,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn hash(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
        let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
        hasher.update(&bincode::serialize(&self).unwrap());
        let result = hasher.finalize();
        let mut hash = [0u8; 32];
        hash.copy_from_slice(&result);
        hash
    }
    
    pub fn calculate_fee_rate(&self, get_output: impl Fn(&[u8; 32], u32) -> Option<TransactionOutput>) -> Option<u64> {
        let mut input_value = 0;
        for input in &self.inputs {
            let outpoint = &input.outpoint;
            let output = get_output(&outpoint.txid, outpoint.vout)?;
            input_value += output.value;
        }
        
        let output_value: u64 = self.outputs.iter().map(|o| o.value).sum();
        if input_value <= output_value {
            return None;
        }
        
        let fee = input_value - output_value;
        let size = bincode::serialize(&self).ok()?.len() as u64;
        
        if size == 0 {
            return None;
        }
        
        Some(fee / size)
    }
}
```

### Advanced Difficulty Adjustment

The difficulty adjustment algorithm provides target calculation:

```rust
// Difficulty adjustment algorithm
pub struct DifficultyAdjuster {
    timestamps: Vec<u64>,
    target_timespan: u64,
    last_adjustment_time: u64,
    current_target: u32,
}

impl DifficultyAdjuster {
    pub fn new(initial_target: u32, target_timespan: u64) -> Self {
        Self {
            timestamps: Vec::new(),
            target_timespan,
            last_adjustment_time: SystemTime::now()
                .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
                .unwrap()
                .as_secs(),
            current_target: initial_target,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn add_block_timestamp(&mut self, timestamp: u64) {
        self.timestamps.push(timestamp);
        
        // Keep only the last N timestamps
        const MAX_TIMESTAMPS: usize = 100;
        if self.timestamps.len() > MAX_TIMESTAMPS {
            self.timestamps.remove(0);
        }
    }
    
    pub fn adjust_difficulty(&mut self, height: u64) -> u32 {
        if height % 10 != 0 || self.timestamps.len() < 10 {
            return self.current_target;
        }
        
        let mut timestamps = self.timestamps.clone();
        timestamps.sort();
        
        // Get median time
        let median_index = timestamps.len() / 2;
        let median_time = timestamps[median_index];
        
        // Calculate actual timespan
        let actual_timespan = median_time - self.last_adjustment_time;
        
        // Update last adjustment time
        self.last_adjustment_time = median_time;
        
        // Adjust target based on ratio of actual to target timespan
        let mut new_target = self.current_target;
        
        if actual_timespan < self.target_timespan / 4 {
            // Time is too short, increase difficulty
            new_target = new_target.saturating_sub(new_target / 4);
        } else if actual_timespan > self.target_timespan * 4 {
            // Time is too long, decrease difficulty
            new_target = new_target.saturating_add(new_target / 4);
        } else {
            // Normal adjustment
            let ratio = actual_timespan as f64 / self.target_timespan as f64;
            let adjustment = (self.current_target as f64 * (ratio - 1.0)) as i32;
            new_target = (self.current_target as i32 + adjustment) as u32;
        }
        
        self.current_target = new_target;
        new_target
    }
}
```

### UTXO Set Management

Efficient UTXO tracking and state management:

```rust
pub struct ChainState {
    db: Arc<BlockchainDB>,
    utxo_set: Arc<DashMap<OutPoint, TransactionOutput>>,
    height: AtomicU64,
    best_block_hash: RwLock<[u8; 32]>,
    total_difficulty: AtomicU64,
}

impl ChainState {
    pub fn new(db: Arc<BlockchainDB>) -> Result<Self, StorageError> {
        // Initialize from database
        let height = db.get_height()?;
        let best_hash = db.get_best_block_hash()?;
        let total_difficulty = db.get_total_difficulty()?;
        
        // Initialize UTXO set from database
        let utxo_set = Arc::new(DashMap::new());
        for (key, value) in db.scan_utxos()? {
            let outpoint = bincode::deserialize(&key)?;
            let output = bincode::deserialize(&value)?;
            utxo_set.insert(outpoint, output);
        }
        
        Ok(Self {
            db,
            utxo_set,
            height: AtomicU64::new(height),
            best_block_hash: RwLock::new(best_hash),
            total_difficulty: AtomicU64::new(total_difficulty),
        })
    }
    
    pub fn get_height(&self) -> u64 {
        self.height.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
    }
    
    pub fn get_best_block_hash(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
        *self.best_block_hash.read().unwrap()
    }
    
    pub fn get_total_difficulty(&self) -> u64 {
        self.total_difficulty.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
    }
    
    pub fn get_db(&self) -> &Arc<BlockchainDB> {
        &self.db
    }
    
    pub async fn process_block(&mut self, block: Block) -> Result<bool, StorageError> {
        // Validate the block
        if !self.validate_block(&block)? {
            return Ok(false);
        }
        
        // Get previous block info
        let prev_hash = block.prev_block_hash();
        let prev_block_info = self.db.get_block_info(&prev_hash)?;
        
        // Calculate new height and difficulty
        let new_height = prev_block_info.height + 1;
        let new_difficulty = prev_block_info.total_difficulty + calculate_block_work(block.target());
        
        // Process transactions
        for tx in block.transactions() {
            // Remove spent UTXOs
            for input in tx.inputs() {
                self.utxo_set.remove(&input.outpoint);
            }
            
            // Add new UTXOs
            for (i, output) in tx.outputs().iter().enumerate() {
                let outpoint = OutPoint {
                    txid: tx.hash(),
                    vout: i as u32,
                };
                self.utxo_set.insert(outpoint, output.clone());
            }
        }
        
        // Store block in database
        self.db.store_block(&block, new_height, new_difficulty)?;
        
        // Update chain state
        if new_difficulty > self.total_difficulty.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
            self.height.store(new_height, Ordering::Relaxed);
            *self.best_block_hash.write().unwrap() = block.hash();
            self.total_difficulty.store(new_difficulty, Ordering::Relaxed);
            return Ok(true);
        }
        
        Ok(false)
    }
}
```

### Advanced Cryptographic Features

Supernova integrates forward-looking cryptographic features to enhance privacy and future-proof the blockchain against quantum attacks:

#### Post-Quantum Cryptography

The blockchain implements multiple quantum-resistant signature schemes to ensure security in a post-quantum era:

```rust
/// Supported quantum-resistant signature schemes
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum QuantumScheme {
    /// CRYSTALS-Dilithium signature scheme
    Dilithium,
    /// FALCON signature scheme
    Falcon,
    /// SPHINCS+ signature scheme
    Sphincs,
    /// Hybrid scheme (classical + post-quantum)
    Hybrid(ClassicalScheme),
}

pub struct QuantumKeyPair {
    /// The public key
    pub public_key: Vec<u8>,
    /// The private key (sensitive information)
    private_key: Vec<u8>,
    /// Parameters used for this key pair
    pub parameters: QuantumParameters,
}

impl QuantumKeyPair {
    /// Sign a message using the quantum-resistant secret key.
    pub fn sign(&self, message: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, QuantumError> {
        match &self.parameters.scheme {
            QuantumScheme::Dilithium => {
                match self.parameters.security_level {
                    SecurityLevel::Low => {
                        let sk = pqcrypto_dilithium::dilithium2::SecretKey::from_bytes(&self.private_key)
                            .map_err(|e| QuantumError::InvalidKey(format!("Invalid Dilithium secret key: {}", e)))?;
                        let signature = pqcrypto_dilithium::dilithium2::detached_sign(message, &sk);
                        Ok(signature.as_bytes().to_vec())
                    },
                    // Additional security levels...
                }
            },
            QuantumScheme::Falcon => {
                // Implementation for Falcon would go here
                // For now, return CryptoOperationFailed error with an informative message

## API Implementation

Supernova features a comprehensive API system that provides both RESTful and JSON-RPC interfaces for interacting with the blockchain. This implementation enables seamless integration with exchanges, wallets, and other blockchain services.

### API Architecture

The API system is built with a modular design, ensuring clean separation of concerns:

```rust
//! API routes
//!
//! This module defines the API routes for the Supernova blockchain node.

pub mod blockchain;
pub mod mempool;
pub mod network;
pub mod mining;
pub mod environmental;
pub mod lightning;
pub mod node;
pub mod wallet;

use actix_web::web;

/// Configure all API routes
pub fn configure(cfg: &mut web::ServiceConfig) {
    // Configure API v1 routes
    cfg.service(
        web::scope("/api/v1")
            .configure(blockchain::configure)
            .configure(mempool::configure)
            .configure(network::configure)
            .configure(mining::configure)
            .configure(environmental::configure)
            .configure(lightning::configure)
            .configure(node::configure)
            .configure(wallet::configure)
    );
    
    // Add health check endpoint at root
    cfg.route("/health", web::get().to(health_check));
}
```

Each API module follows a consistent pattern of route configuration, request handling, and response formatting, making the codebase maintainable and extensible. The system uses Actix Web, a powerful, high-performance web framework for Rust, to deliver exceptional throughput and low latency even under high load.

### RESTful API Implementation Details

The Supernova API system uses a typed architecture with comprehensive validation at every level. The core of this implementation includes:

#### Standard Response Pattern

All API responses follow a standardized format for consistency:

```rust
/// Standard API response wrapper
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, ToSchema)]
pub struct ApiResponse<T> {
    /// Whether the request was successful
    pub success: bool,
    /// Response data (only present if success is true)
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub data: Option<T>,
    /// Error message (only present if success is false)
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub error: Option<String>,
}

impl<T> ApiResponse<T> {
    /// Create a successful response
    pub fn success(data: T) -> Self {
        Self {
            success: true,
            data: Some(data),
            error: None,
        }
    }
    
    /// Create an error response
    pub fn error(message: impl Into<String>) -> Self {
        Self {
            success: false,
            data: None,
            error: Some(message.into()),
        }
    }
}
```

#### Wallet API Implementation

The wallet API module provides comprehensive functionality for wallet management:

```rust
/// Configure wallet API routes
pub fn configure(cfg: &mut web::ServiceConfig) {
    cfg.service(
        web::scope("/wallet")
            .route("/info", web::get().to(get_wallet_info))
            .route("/balance", web::get().to(get_wallet_balance))
            .route("/addresses", web::get().to(list_addresses))
            .route("/addresses/{address}", web::get().to(get_address_info))
            .route("/addresses/new", web::post().to(create_new_address))
            .route("/transactions", web::get().to(list_transactions))
            .route("/transactions/{txid}", web::get().to(get_transaction_info))
            .route("/utxos", web::get().to(list_utxos))
            .route("/send", web::post().to(send_transaction))
            .route("/sign", web::post().to(sign_message_or_tx))
            .route("/verify", web::post().to(verify_message))
            .route("/label", web::post().to(set_address_label))
            .route("/lock", web::post().to(lock_wallet))
            .route("/unlock", web::post().to(unlock_wallet))
            .route("/backup", web::post().to(create_backup)),
    );
}
```

Each endpoint is implemented with comprehensive error handling, input validation, and type safety. For example, the implementation of the `create_new_address` endpoint:

```rust
/// Create a new address
#[utoipa::path(
    post,
    path = "/api/v1/wallet/addresses/new",
    request_body = AddressRequest,
    responses(
        (status = 200, description = "Address created successfully", body = ApiResponse<AddressResponse>),
        (status = 400, description = "Invalid request", body = ApiError),
        (status = 401, description = "Unauthorized", body = ApiError),
        (status = 500, description = "Internal server error", body = ApiError)
    ),
    security(
        ("api_key" = [])
    )
)]
pub async fn create_new_address(
    node: web::Data<Arc<Node>>,
    req: web::Json<AddressRequest>,
) -> ApiResult<impl Responder> {
    debug!("Create new address: {:?}", req);
    
    // Get wallet from node
    let wallet = node.get_wallet()
        .ok_or_else(|| ApiError::internal("Wallet not available"))?;
    
    // Apply request parameters
    let label = req.label.clone();
    let address_type = req.type_.clone().unwrap_or_else(|| "receive".to_string());
    let quantum_resistant = req.quantum_resistant.unwrap_or(false);
    
    // Create new address
    let address_response = wallet.create_new_address(&address_type, &label, quantum_resistant)
        .map_err(|e| ApiError::internal(format!("Error creating address: {}", e)))?;
    
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().json(ApiResponse::success(address_response)))
}
```

The API embraces modern Rust development practices with:

1. Async/await for non-blocking operation
2. Type-safe error handling with Result types
3. OpenAPI documentation with utoipa
4. Comprehensive logging
5. Secure dependency injection
6. Proper resource cleanup

#### Comprehensive Type System

The API system defines a rich set of data types for request/response handling, ensuring type safety and proper serialization:

```rust
/// Transaction information
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, ToSchema)]
pub struct Transaction {
    /// Transaction ID
    pub txid: String,
    
    /// Timestamp
    pub time: String,
    
    /// Amount in satoshis (positive for receive, negative for send)
    pub amount: i64,
    
    /// Fee in satoshis
    pub fee: u64,
    
    /// Number of confirmations
    pub confirmations: u32,
    
    /// Block height
    pub height: Option<u32>,
    
    /// Block hash
    pub blockhash: Option<String>,
    
    /// Transaction category (send, receive, generate, immature, fee)
    pub category: String,
    
    /// Address (primary address for transaction)
    pub address: Option<String>,
    
    /// Label (user-defined)
    pub label: Option<String>,
    
    /// Transaction inputs
    pub inputs: Vec<TransactionInput>,
    
    /// Transaction outputs
    pub outputs: Vec<TransactionOutput>,
    
    /// Carbon footprint of the transaction
    pub carbon_footprint: Option<CarbonFootprint>,
    
    /// Raw transaction hex (if requested)
    pub raw: Option<String>,
}
```

### RESTful API Modules

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8332" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "getblockchaininfo",
    "params": []
  }'

# Response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1",
  "result": {
    "chain": "main",
    "blocks": 123456,
    "headers": 123456,
    "bestblockhash": "00000000000000000007ab12ca7931bed88ddb0e36edc99b063c6d469d6375b4",
    "difficulty": 123456789,

- Detection of multiple corruption types:
  - File-level corruption (damaged or missing files)
  - Record-level corruption (individual corrupted records)
  - Index corruption (damaged database indexes)
  - Logical corruption (inconsistencies in blockchain state)
  - Checkpoint corruption (damaged recovery points)

#### Recovery Strategies
The system implements several recovery strategies based on the type and severity of corruption detected:
- **Restore from Backup**: Complete restoration from the most recent valid backup
- **Rebuild Corrupted Records**: Targeted repair of specific corrupted database entries
- **Rebuild Indexes**: Reconstruction of damaged database indexes while preserving core data
- **Revert to Checkpoint**: Rolling back to the last verified consistent state
- **Rebuild Chain State**: Complete reconstruction of blockchain state from genesis

#### CorruptionHandler Implementation
Supernova's `CorruptionHandler` provides:
- Automated selection of optimal recovery strategy based on corruption type
- Checkpoint management for rapid recovery to known-good states
- Detailed logging of corruption events and recovery attempts
- Configurable retry policies for repair operations
- Notification system for critical corruption events

#### Preventive Measures
- Automatic creation of regular database checkpoints
- Scheduled integrity checks to detect corruption early
- Incremental backups of critical data
- Redundant storage of blockchain state

This comprehensive approach ensures high availability and data integrity even in the face of hardware failures, network issues, or software bugs.
