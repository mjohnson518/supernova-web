# Supernova Core Documentation

This section provides detailed documentation about the core components and concepts of the Supernova blockchain.

## Overview

Supernova Core is the reference implementation of the Supernova blockchain protocol. It provides all the fundamental functionality needed to participate in the Supernova network, including:

- Blockchain validation and consensus
- Transaction processing and mempool management
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Wallet functionality
- API services

## Key Components

### Consensus Engine

The consensus engine implements Supernova's environmentally-aware proof-of-work consensus mechanism. It includes:

- Block validation rules
- Difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Mining interface
- Fork resolution

[Learn more about consensus rules](../technical-docs/consensus-rules.md)

### Transaction Processing

The transaction processing subsystem handles:

- Transaction validation
- Mempool management and prioritization
- Fee estimation
- UTXO set management

### Network Layer

The network layer implements the peer-to-peer protocol, including:

- Node discovery and connection management
- Block and transaction propagation
- Peer reputation system
- Sybil attack resistance

### Wallet

The integrated wallet functionality provides:

- Key management (HD wallet support)
- Transaction creation and signing
- Address generation and management
- Balance tracking

### API Services

Multiple API interfaces are provided:

- JSON-RPC API for compatibility with existing tools
- REST API for web applications
- WebSocket API for real-time notifications
