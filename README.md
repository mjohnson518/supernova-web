# Supernova Blockchain Website

A modern website for the Supernova blockchain project, featuring quantum resistance and environmental impact monitoring capabilities.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Recent Updates

### Styling Fix (2023-11-11)
- Removed Tailwind CSS dependencies to resolve PostCSS plugin configuration conflicts
- Simplified SCSS files by using hardcoded values instead of CSS variables
- Updated component styling to use direct color values and gradients
- Streamlined Next.js configuration for better compatibility

## Features

- **Quantum Resistance**: Future-proof your blockchain with post-quantum cryptographic primitives.
- **Environmental Impact**: Track and mitigate carbon emissions with built-in tools.
- **Lightning Network**: Scale transactions off-chain with integrated Lightning Network support.
- **Advanced Security**: Multi-layered protection against various attacks.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Built-in metrics collection framework.
- **Production Ready**: Designed with reliability in mind.
- **Modern, responsive design**
- **Community engagement platform**
- **Comprehensive documentation**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
