## Sustainability Overview

Supernova differs from traditional blockchains by prioritizing environmental sustainability. Key aspects include:

- **Renewable Energy Validation** - Validators must prove renewable energy usage
- **Carbon Offsetting** - Built-in mechanisms to fund carbon capture projects
- **Energy-Efficient Consensus** - Optimized for minimal energy consumption
- **Impact Reporting** - Transparent tracking of environmental metrics

Supernova aims to be the first truly carbon-negative blockchain platform, actively reducing the global carbon footprint rather than simply minimizing its impact.

## Environmental Metrics

The Supernova network continuously monitors these environmental metrics:

1. Energy consumption per transaction
2. Percentage of renewable energy used across the network
3. Carbon offsets purchased and applied
4. Net carbon impact (negative numbers indicate carbon removal)

These metrics are publicly available on the network explorer and status dashboard.
