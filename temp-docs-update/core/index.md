## Core Architecture

Supernova's architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Consensus Layer** - Implements the hybrid PoS/renewable energy validation mechanism
2. **Execution Layer** - Processes transactions and smart contracts
3. **Data Layer** - Manages blockchain state and history
4. **Network Layer** - Handles peer discovery and communication
5. **API Layer** - Provides interfaces for interacting with the blockchain

These components work together to create a scalable, sustainable blockchain platform capable of supporting enterprise-grade applications while maintaining a negative carbon footprint.

## Design Principles

The core components of Supernova were designed with the following principles:

- **Sustainability** - Environmental impact is a first-class consideration
- **Scalability** - Architecture supports high transaction throughput
- **Security** - Forward-looking security against classical and quantum threats
- **Simplicity** - Clean interfaces between components
- **Interoperability** - Designed to work with existing blockchain ecosystems

The documentation in this section provides details on how these principles are implemented in the core architecture.
